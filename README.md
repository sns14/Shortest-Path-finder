# Shortest-Path-finder

The ShortestPath project is a Python script designed to find and visualize the shortest path in a grid from a start point (S) to an end point (E) using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The grid includes walls (#) that obstruct the path, and open spaces ( ) through which the path can be taken.
Using the curses library, the script provides a real-time visualization of the pathfinding process in a terminal window, highlighting the path as it searches from the start to the end point.
